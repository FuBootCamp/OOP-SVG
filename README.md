## Description of the project
This challenge was to create a scalable vector graphic (SVG) using object oriented programming tools such as “contructors”, “classes”, “Inheritance”, “polymorphism” and “exceptions test”, but, I didn't know how to do it.

I think object oriented programming introduces quite abstract concepts that I believe require a lot of practice to understand. So I will need more time to study and put them into practice.

Therefore, I will not be able to deliver this challenge in time, but I will try to do it later.

I have defined a strategy to continue with this challenge little by little without being delayed in the other activities. I think this might be complicated, but I want to try.I will continue to record the progress in the repository and when it is ready, I will make a second delivery.

Thanks
