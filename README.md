## Description of the project
Description

The challenge was to create a scalable vector graphic (SVG) using "classes", "inherited classes" and "tests" by obtaining user data through a command line interface.

I failed to deliver this challenge on time. The reason was that I failed to understand most of the concepts in chapter 10 and when I tackled the mini project I did not find a way to solve it. Faced with the frustration of not being able to solve the mini project, I assumed that I would not be able to solve the challenge and decided to leave it for later, when I had time to review and understand the topics in the chapter.

I think the main problem with the mini-project was that I did not understand the acceptance criteria. But after carefully reviewing the instructions and related concepts, I was able to understand the mini project and the tools used for coding.

In the challenge it was easier for me to understand the declaration of a CLASS, as was the case of a SHAPE, and then how to generate the instances of that class with the NEW command. (CIRCLE, TRIANGLE and  RECTANGLE) Also to understand how a class INHERITS a SCOPE to the generated instances.

To understand the usefulness of the TEST to prove that the applications are generating the expected results, seems to me an extremely useful tool, that surely will help us to achieve the quality assurance in the applications.


Finally, this challenge had an additional motivation, as I left it pending thinking that it might be one of the tasks that I would not turn in during the bootcamp. The time I have had to dedicate to the bootcamp has been much more than I thought it would demand, and I came to believe that I would not have enough time to look at this pending task. But in the end I did it and I am very happy for two things, the knowledge acquired and for fulfilling, even if it is late, the assignment.

## Installation instructions
The application includes a walkthrough video showing the creation of three figures, first a yellow circle with red text, then a blue square with white text and finally a red triangle with white text. For the triangle, the color of the shape is fed in hexadecimal.
The final part of the video shows the execution of the test which includes a test for each figure.
